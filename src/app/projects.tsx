    title: "Rent the Runway",
    desc: "Performed in-depth exploratory data analysis on Rent the Runway dataset, uncovering trends in customer behavior, product ratings, and fit satisfaction. Analyzed rental patterns across age groups, body types, and seasons. Applied sentiment analysis on reviews and visualized insights using 2D/3D plots to inform customer segmentation and occasion-based marketing strategies.",

    title: "Graph Embedding",
    desc: "Designed a custom embedding approach for a bipartite ingredient-nutrient graph to represent nutritional relationships in lower-dimensional space. Built a biased random walk algorithm influenced by edge weights (normalized nutrition values) to better preserve feature significance during embedding. This technique improved ingredient clustering for dietary recommendation systems.",

    title: "Blender Game Engine",
    desc: "Created interactive game prototypes and 3D models using Blender Game Engine (v2.79). Built multiple .blend files demonstrating mechanics like player movement, collisions, shooting, and scene rendering.",

    title: "Delegates Relation Extraction",
    desc: "Built an NLP-powered pipeline to extract executive names and job titles (e.g., CEO, VP) from M&A press releases using web scraping, Named Entity Recognition, and relationship extraction. Automated the analysis of SEC filings and business blogs to identify key delegates involved in high-value deals, reducing manual effort in business intelligence workflows.",

    title: "Unique Meal Plan Prepration",
    desc: "Built a bipartite graph-based system to recommend meal plans based on nutritional values and ingredient compatibility. Designed a custom graph embedding (not based on conventional DeepWalk) and applied K-Means clustering to group similar ingredients. Enabled allergy-aware substitutions for dietary constraints. The model supports ingredient-level personalization and aims to assist hospitals and individuals in preparing nutrition-optimized recipes with minimal human intervention.",

    title: "Personalized Fashion Recommendation",
    desc: "Developed a recommendation system using H&Mâ€™s customer, article, and transaction data (31M+ records) to generate personalized fashion suggestions based on purchase history and demographic clusters. Leveraged association rules, unsupervised clustering (by age), and metadata preprocessing to enhance the shopping experience and reduce decision fatigue. Optimized data handling using GPU-based processing (cudf) and memory-efficient formats (.parquet) for scalable insights.",
